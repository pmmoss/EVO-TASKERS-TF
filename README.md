# EVO-TASKERS-TF - AI Generated DRAFT README

This repository is designed to manage and deploy various application solutions using Terraform. Each project within this repository represents a large application, typically contained within its own Git repository, and consists of multiple smaller resources. The goal is to deploy each application solution to a dedicated Azure Function App, allowing for efficient management and scaling.

## Structure

- **Global Terraform Configuration**: This repository includes global Terraform configurations that are outside of our direct control, specifically for data resources. These configurations ensure consistency and compliance across all projects.

- **Projects**: Each project is a distinct application solution, broken down into manageable components. These projects are designed to be deployed to Azure Function Apps, providing a serverless compute environment that is both scalable and cost-effective.

- **Environments**: The repository supports multiple environments, including Development (Dev), Quality Assurance (QA), and Production (Prod). This allows for isolated deployments and testing, ensuring that changes can be thoroughly vetted before reaching production.

## Deployment Strategy

- **Function Apps**: Each application solution is deployed to a dedicated Azure Function App. This approach leverages the benefits of serverless computing, such as automatic scaling and reduced operational overhead.

- **Environment-Specific Deployments**: The infrastructure for each environment (Dev, QA, Prod) can be deployed separately. This flexibility allows for the replacement of compute resources with different types if necessary, without affecting other environments.

## Usage

To deploy a project, navigate to the respective project directory and execute the Terraform commands to initialize, plan, and apply the configuration. Ensure that the appropriate environment variables and Terraform variables are set for the target environment.

This repository is structured to facilitate continuous integration and deployment, making it suitable for use with Azure DevOps pipelines or other CI/CD tools.

For more detailed instructions on deploying specific projects or configuring environments, refer to the README files located within each project directory.
