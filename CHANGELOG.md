## [1.0.0] - Previous

### Existing Features
- Terraform workspace-based multi-environment support
- Reusable modules (networking, key vault, storage, etc.)
- Common infrastructure setup
- Multiple application deployments

## Migration Notes

### From 1.0.0 to 1.1.0

**Breaking Changes**: None - All existing Terraform code continues to work

**Action Required**:
1. Fix hardcoded backend configurations (run `pipelines/setup/fix-backend-configs.sh`)
2. Set up Azure DevOps infrastructure (follow COMPLETE-SETUP-GUIDE.md)
3. Gradually migrate from manual to pipeline deployments

**Backward Compatibility**: 
- ✅ Existing Terraform code unchanged
- ✅ Existing modules unchanged
- ✅ Existing state files compatible
- ✅ Manual deployments still possible (but not recommended)
